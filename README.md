# Logogringo - Leave the cold behind

## Instructions

* Copy the code from `index.html` that's between the comments `<!-- COPY FROM HERE -->` and `<!-- END OF COPYING -->`
* All the images are inserted in the html (not inside of the css), so it's easy to change the url. Make sure the path is the correct one, otherwise, replace all of them
* We have only one css and it won't affect any of the existing css.
